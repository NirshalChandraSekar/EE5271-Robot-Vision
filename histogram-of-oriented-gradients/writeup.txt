EE 5271 Assignment 1: HOG Feature and Face Detection

Overview
This writeup summarizes my implementation of a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
feature extractor and a simple face detection pipeline using normalized cross-correlation
(NCC) on HOG descriptors. The implementation follows the assignment specification and
visualizes both HOG features and face detections.

HOG Feature Extraction
1) Preprocessing: The input grayscale image is converted to float and normalized to [0, 1].
2) Gradients: x and y image derivatives are computed using 3x3 differential filters
   (Sobel-style). Gradient magnitude and unsigned orientation are computed, with angles
   in [0, pi).
3) Orientation Binning: The image is divided into non-overlapping cells of size 8x8.
   For each cell, a 6-bin histogram is built using the angle ranges defined in the PDF
   (bin centers every 30 degrees with 15-degree boundaries and wrap-around).
4) Block Normalization: 2x2 cell blocks are concatenated (24 values per block) and
   L2-normalized with epsilon = 0.001 to improve illumination/contrast invariance.
5) Descriptor: All normalized block descriptors are concatenated to form the final HOG
   feature vector.

Face Detection
1) Template HOG: Compute the HOG descriptor for the 50x50 template and zero-mean it.
2) Sliding Window: For each possible 50x50 patch in the target image, compute HOG,
   zero-mean it, and compute the NCC score with the template descriptor.
3) Thresholding: Retain detections with NCC >= 0.5.
4) Non-Maximum Suppression: Apply NMS with IoU threshold 0.5 to remove overlapping
   detections and keep the strongest boxes.

Notes
- Cell size: 8, block size: 2, number of bins: 6.
- Unsigned gradients are used (theta == theta + pi).
- Final visualization shows detections after NMS.
